Since age five, I’ve been blessed with kittens that I’ve chosen by hand, strays that adopted me, and a handful of other feline friends I cohabitated with, to varying degrees of affection and success.",

And since so many others — and so many authors — feel similarly, there’s a whole host of books built around the feline species for us and our kids to enjoy.",
